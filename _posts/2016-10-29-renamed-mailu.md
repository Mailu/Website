In the past few weeks and months, this project has gained some interesting
traction and as mentionned by some contributors, it was time for us to get
a proper name that did not sound like a mockery to the work of people at
Poste.io.

We decided to rename the projet to *Mailu*, both read *Mail You* and
*Ma-i-lu*, as in a small south-pacific island that looked just like one of
our Docker containers.

The rename happended right before we release version 1.3 and migration guides
will be posted for administrators already running Freeposte.io. It also happens
that we did some statistics on known running instances, and we are proud to
announce that Mailu has processed over 10 million emails so far and delivered
over a million (around 9 spams out of 10 received emails !)
