The past few weeks have been very productive thanks to multiple contributors
and reporters. A hundred commits later, Freeposte.io release 1.2 is ready.

Most changes in the release are security-related: we eventually added CSRF
checks, applied most security best practices including TLS hardening based
on the great documentation by [BetterCrypto](https://bettercrypto.org/),
and started a discussion about how the mail server stack should be
secure-by-default while maintaining as many features as possible.

Additional great change is the new ability to declare catch-all aliases and
wildcard aliases in general.

![Catchall alias](/images/catchall_alias.png)

When creating an alias, one may now enable the "SQL LIKE" syntax then use
standard SQL wildcards ``%`` and ``_`` to specify matches for a given alias.
For instance :

- ``%@domain.tld`` will match any uncatched email sent to that domain (catch-all)
- ``support-%@domain.tld`` will match any email sent to an address starting with
  ``support-``
- ``_@domain.tld`` will match any email sent to a one-character address
- ``co_tact@domain.tld`` will match both ``contact@domain.tld`` and
  ``comtact@domain.tld`` along will all other combinations to make up for
  any usual typing mistake.

Finally, the update process changed with Freeposte.io 1.2: you do not have to
manually setup an installed branch anymore. Instead, you may simply use the
default ``docker-compose.yml`` file and the ``:latest`` tag that will now
point to the latest *stable* version. Those who know what they are doing and
still want to use continuous builds from the Git repository may switch to the
``:testing`` Docker images.

A more detailed list of changes is available in the project [changelog](https://github.com/kaiyou/freeposte.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
